In the case of the closure of a website, the fonts and/or the license to use the fonts cannot be transferred.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The number of pageviews per month your websites may serve depends on the specified licensed number of pageviews per month purchased and referenced during your purchase and on your invoice. You are obliged to record and control the number of monthly pageviews for your websites. If at any point the number of pageviews per month to your websites exceeds the specified number of pageviews per month referenced during your purchase and on your invoice you are obliged to purchase a licensing upgrade.
